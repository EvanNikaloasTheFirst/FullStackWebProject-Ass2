CSY2028 Web Programming PHP & MySQL Assignment 2
Aim & Objective
The purpose of this assignment was to assess the ability to modify and improve PHP code on an existing PHP/MySQL driven website.

Brief
As a developer for a web design agency, you were given a task to work for a new client called Jo's Jobs. The company runs a small recruitment agency, and the website is used to list available jobs. The website was developed several years ago by Jo's cousin, but now it's a little outdated and contains bugs that need fixing. The administration area is available in the /admin/ directory, and the password is letmein.

The following is an excerpt from one of Jo's emails regarding the changes she wants you to make:

Changed the copyright notice.
Added a new page called "FAQs" with some placeholder text.
Fixed a bug that was causing added categories to not appear on the list of jobs or the navigation bar.
Added an archive feature to re-post old jobs easily.
Added the category name for each job as a column in the table and made it so that jobs could be filtered by category.
Made it so that customers could filter the jobs by location.
Created a user management system with separate usernames and passwords for each member of staff.
Added client user accounts, so they could access a restricted version of the admin area, add jobs and see who has applied for them.
Displayed jobs that are about to reach the closing date on the website's home page.
Added a form on the contact page to store the inquiry instead of sending it via email, and created a system to list previous inquiries and which member of staff dealt with them.

I achieved an A.
